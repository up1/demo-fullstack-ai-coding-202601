# Business Goal
Customers must be able to log in to the system using a username and password in order to access protected features.

# Stakeholder Notes
- Login is required before using any core functionality.
- Users already exist in the system.
- Authentication should be simple and familiar to end users.
- Incorrect credentials should not reveal whether the username or password is wrong.
- Login failures should be handled gracefully.

# Constraints
- Username and password authentication only (no social login).
- Must follow basic security best practices.
- No password reset or registration in this phase.
- Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
